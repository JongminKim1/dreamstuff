1. Introduction

2. Development
first, download the sources of i-mesh:
git svn clone -r 287 https://dreamstuff.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ dreamstuff --username lai.jingwen2008



2.1 required librareis
    to successfully compile the sources, you should have Qt4,boost,CGAL installed
    if you're using ubuntu. these are trival:
    a) sudo apt-get install qt4-dev-tools
    b) sudo apt-get install libboost1.40-dev
    c) browse www.cgal.org to download the cgal or go directly to:
    https://gforge.inria.fr/frs/?group_id=52
    d) download the related gmp and mpfr library
    e) install the numeric libraries:
       sudo apt-get install liblapack
       sudo apt-get install libblas

2.2 compiled 3rdparty libraries
    2.2.1 assimp      
      I use assimp to import differ file formats.
      ref: assimp.sourceforge.net
    2.2.2 libQGLViewer
    	  I use libQGLViewer to ease the development of render and manipulator
	  ref. www.libqglviewer.com
    2.2.3 CGAL
    	  CGAL is used to store the internal structure of the mesh
    2.2.4 PythonLibs
    	  first, install Python first, then install PythonQt
	  a) sudo apt-get install python2.6-dev
	  b) currently,I use PythonQt 1.1 , authough the version 2.0 is released.
	  pythonqt.sourceforege.net
	  (http://sf.net/projects/pythonqt/files/)
	  after compiled pythonqt, you should add the lib and install to the system profile.
