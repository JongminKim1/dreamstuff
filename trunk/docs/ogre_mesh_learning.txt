Ogre Mesh reading notes

Introduction:
	There maybe two ways to incorporate the objects for rendering with OGRE,
	first is use the ManualObject, the second maybe Mesh(todo)

The first way: ManualObject
    using manualObject is just like using GL-code.you specify position,normal,and colour for the vertex, and this can be recognized by OGRE.
  like any other MovableObject you should attach the object to a SceneNode to make it visible.
  here is a paragraph that may be useful:
  You can also use beginUpdate() to alter the geometry later if you wish. If you do this, you should call setDynamic(true) before your first call to begin(),
  and also consider using estimateVertexCount/estimateIndexCount if your geometry is going to be growing,to avoid buffer recreation during growth.
  note: the first tip is useful when you creating mesh deformation appliccation,
  the second tip is useful when you creating subdivision application.
    See the documentations for more details

 <Bold>The second way</Bold>
	   The *Mesh* class:
	   The mesh class is much more complex.
	   TODO: read the .mesh format specification ,and read the source about
	   how to read a .mesh file in OGRE maybe a good starting point to
	   know how OGRE work with it's Mesh Class.
