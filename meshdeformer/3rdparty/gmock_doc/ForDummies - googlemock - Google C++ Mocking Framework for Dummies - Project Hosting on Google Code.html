A <STRONG>mock object</STRONG> implements the same interface as a real object (so it can be used as one), but lets you specify at run time how it will be used and what it should do (which methods will be called? in which order? how many times? with what arguments? what will they return? etc). </P><P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG> It is easy to confuse the term <I>fake objects</I> with mock objects. Fakes and mocks actually mean very different things in the Test-Driven Development (TDD) community: </P><UL><LI><STRONG>Fake</STRONG> objects have working implementations, but usually take some shortcut (perhaps to make the operations less expensive), which makes them not suitable for production. An in-memory file system would be an example of a fake.  </LI><LI><STRONG>Mocks</STRONG> are objects pre-programmed with <I>expectations</I>, which form a specification of the calls they are expected to receive.  </LI></UL><P>If all this seems too abstract for you, don't worry - the most important thing to remember is that a mock allows you to check the <I>interaction</I> between itself and code that uses it. The difference between fakes and mocks will become much clearer once you start to use mocks. </P></A><P><A name="What_Is_Google_C++_Mocking_Framework?"><STRONG>Google C++ Mocking Framework</STRONG> (or <STRONG>Google Mock</STRONG> for short) is a library (sometimes we also call it a "framework" to make it sound cool) for creating mock classes and using them. It does to C++ what </A><A href="http://www.jmock.org/" rel="nofollow">jMock</A> and <A href="http://www.easymock.org/" rel="nofollow">EasyMock</A> do to Java. </P><P>Using Google Mock involves three basic steps:   </P><OL><LI>Use some simple macros to describe the interface you want to mock, and they will expand to the implementation of your mock class;  </LI><LI>Create some mock objects and specify its expectations and behavior using an intuitive syntax;  </LI><LI>Exercise code that uses the mock objects. Google Mock will catch any violation of the expectations as soon as it arises.  </LI></OL><P></P><H1><A name="Why_Google_Mock?">Why Google Mock?</A></H1><A name="Why_Google_Mock?"><P>While mock objects help you remove unnecessary dependencies in tests and make them fast and reliable, using mocks manually in C++ is <I>hard</I>: </P><UL><LI>Someone has to implement the mocks. The job is usually tedious and error-prone. No wonder people go great distance to avoid it.  </LI><LI>The quality of those manually written mocks is a bit, uh, unpredictable. You may see some really polished ones, but you may also see some that were hacked up in a hurry and have all sorts of ad hoc restrictions.  </LI><LI>The knowledge you gained from using one mock doesn't transfer to the next.  </LI></UL><P>In contrast, Java and Python programmers have some fine mock frameworks, which automate the creation of mocks. As a result, mocking is a proven effective technique and widely adopted practice in those communities. Having the right tool absolutely makes the difference. </P></A><P><A name="Why_Google_Mock?">Google Mock was built to help C++ programmers. It was inspired by </A><A href="http://www.jmock.org/" rel="nofollow">jMock</A> and <A href="http://www.easymock.org/" rel="nofollow">EasyMock</A>, but designed with C++'s specifics in mind. It is your friend if any of the following problems is bothering you:   </P><UL><LI>You are stuck with a sub-optimal design and wish you had done more prototyping before it was too late, but prototyping in C++ is by no means "rapid".  </LI><LI>Your tests are slow as they depend on too many libraries or use expensive resources (e.g. a database).  </LI><LI>Your tests are brittle as some resources they use are unreliable (e.g. the network).  </LI><LI>You want to test how your code handles a failure (e.g. a file checksum error), but it's not easy to cause one.  </LI><LI>You need to make sure that your module interacts with other modules in the right way, but it's hard to observe the interaction; therefore you resort to observing the side effects at the end of the action, which is awkward at best.  </LI><LI>You want to "mock out" your dependencies, except that they don't have mock implementations yet; and, frankly, you aren't thrilled by some of those hand-written mocks.  </LI></UL><P></P><P>We encourage you to use Google Mock as: </P><UL><LI>a <I>design</I> tool, for it lets you experiment with your interface design early and often. More iterations lead to better designs!  </LI><LI>a <I>testing</I> tool to cut your tests' outbound dependencies and probe the interaction between your module and its collaborators.  </LI></UL><H1><A name="Getting_Started">Getting Started</A></H1><A name="Getting_Started"><P>Using Google Mock is easy!

Suppose you are developing a graphics program that relies on a LOGO-like API for drawing. How would you test that it does the right thing? Well, you can run it and compare the screen with a golden screen snapshot, but let's admit it: tests like this are expensive to run and fragile (What if you just upgraded to a shiny new graphics card that has better anti-aliasing? Suddenly you have to update all your golden images.). It would be too painful if all your tests are like this. Fortunately, you learned about Dependency Injection and know the right thing to do: instead of having your application talk to the drawing API directly, wrap the API in an interface (say, <TT>Turtle</TT>) and code to that interface: </P><PRE class="prettyprint"><SPAN class="kwd">class</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"> </SPAN><SPAN class="typ">Turtle</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"> </SPAN><SPAN class="pun">{</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"><BR>&nbsp; </SPAN><SPAN class="pun">...</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"><BR>&nbsp; </SPAN><SPAN class="kwd">virtual</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"> </SPAN><SPAN class="pun">~</SPAN><SPAN class="typ">Turtle</SPAN><SPAN class="pun">()</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"> </SPAN><SPAN class="pun">{}</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"><BR>&nbsp; </SPAN><SPAN class="kwd">virtual</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"> </SPAN><SPAN class="kwd">void</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"> </SPAN><SPAN class="typ">PenUp</SPAN><SPAN class="pun">()</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"> </SPAN><SPAN class="pun">=</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"> </SPAN><SPAN class="lit">0</SPAN><SPAN class="pun">;</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"><BR>&nbsp; </SPAN><SPAN class="kwd">virtual</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"> </SPAN><SPAN class="kwd">void</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"> </SPAN><SPAN class="typ">PenDown</SPAN><SPAN class="pun">()</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"> </SPAN><SPAN class="pun">=</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"> </SPAN><SPAN class="lit">0</SPAN><SPAN class="pun">;</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"><BR>&nbsp; </SPAN><SPAN class="kwd">virtual</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"> </SPAN><SPAN class="kwd">void</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"> </SPAN><SPAN class="typ">Forward</SPAN><SPAN class="pun">(</SPAN><SPAN class="kwd">int</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"> distance</SPAN><SPAN class="pun">)</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"> </SPAN><SPAN class="pun">=</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"> </SPAN><SPAN class="lit">0</SPAN><SPAN class="pun">;</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"><BR>&nbsp; </SPAN><SPAN class="kwd">virtual</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"> </SPAN><SPAN class="kwd">void</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"> </SPAN><SPAN class="typ">Turn</SPAN><SPAN class="pun">(</SPAN><SPAN class="kwd">int</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"> degrees</SPAN><SPAN class="pun">)</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"> </SPAN><SPAN class="pun">=</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"> </SPAN><SPAN class="lit">0</SPAN><SPAN class="pun">;</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"><BR>&nbsp; </SPAN><SPAN class="kwd">virtual</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"> </SPAN><SPAN class="kwd">void</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"> </SPAN><SPAN class="typ">GoTo</SPAN><SPAN class="pun">(</SPAN><SPAN class="kwd">int</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"> x</SPAN><SPAN class="pun">,</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"> </SPAN><SPAN class="kwd">int</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"> y</SPAN><SPAN class="pun">)</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"> </SPAN><SPAN class="pun">=</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"> </SPAN><SPAN class="lit">0</SPAN><SPAN class="pun">;</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"><BR>&nbsp; </SPAN><SPAN class="kwd">virtual</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"> </SPAN><SPAN class="kwd">int</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"> </SPAN><SPAN class="typ">GetX</SPAN><SPAN class="pun">()</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"> </SPAN><SPAN class="kwd">const</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"> </SPAN><SPAN class="pun">=</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"> </SPAN><SPAN class="lit">0</SPAN><SPAN class="pun">;</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"><BR>&nbsp; </SPAN><SPAN class="kwd">virtual</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"> </SPAN><SPAN class="kwd">int</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"> </SPAN><SPAN class="typ">GetY</SPAN><SPAN class="pun">()</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"> </SPAN><SPAN class="kwd">const</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"> </SPAN><SPAN class="pun">=</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"> </SPAN><SPAN class="lit">0</SPAN><SPAN class="pun">;</SPAN><SPAN class="pln"><BR></SPAN><SPAN class="pun">};</SPAN></PRE><P>(Note that the destructor of <TT>Turtle</TT> <STRONG>must</STRONG> be virtual, as is the case for <STRONG>all</STRONG> classes you intend to inherit from - otherwise the destructor of the derived class will not be called when you delete an object through a base pointer, and you'll get corrupted program states like memory leaks.) </P><P>You can control whether the turtle's movement will leave a trace using <TT>PenUp()</TT> and <TT>PenDown()</TT>, and control its movement using <TT>Forward()</TT>, <TT>Turn()</TT>, and <TT>GoTo()</TT>.

It's that simple! Once you get the hang of it, you can pump out mock classes faster than your source-control system can handle your check-ins. </P></A><P><A name="How_to_Define_It"><STRONG>Tip:</STRONG> If even this is too much work for you, you'll find the <TT>gmock_gen.py</TT> tool in Google Mock's <TT>scripts/generator/</TT> directory (courtesy of the </A><A href="http://code.google.com/p/cppclean/" rel="nofollow">cppclean</A> project) useful.  This command-line tool requires that you have Python 2.4 installed.  You give it a C++ file and the name of an abstract class defined in it, and it will print the definition of the mock class for you.  Due to the complexity of the C++ language, this script may not always work, but it can be quite handy when it does.  For more details, read the <A href="http://code.google.com/p/googlemock/source/browse/trunk/scripts/generator/README" rel="nofollow">user documentation</A>. </P><H2><A name="Where_to_Put_It">Where to Put It</A></H2><A name="Where_to_Put_It"><P>When you define a mock class, you need to decide where to put its definition. Some people put it in a <TT>*_test.cc</TT>. This is fine when the interface being mocked (say, <TT>Foo</TT>) is owned by the same person or team. Otherwise, when the owner of <TT>Foo</TT> changes it, your test could break. (You can't really expect <TT>Foo</TT>'s maintainer to fix every test that uses <TT>Foo</TT>, can you?) </P><P>So, the rule of thumb is: if you need to mock <TT>Foo</TT> and it's owned by others, define the mock class in <TT>Foo</TT>'s package (better, in a <TT>testing</TT> sub-package such that you can clearly separate production code and testing utilities), and put it in a <TT>mock_foo.h</TT>. Then everyone can reference <TT>mock_foo.h</TT> from their tests. If <TT>Foo</TT> ever changes, there is only one copy of <TT>MockFoo</TT> to change, and only tests that depend on the changed methods need to be fixed. </P><P>Another way to do it: you can introduce a thin layer <TT>FooAdaptor</TT> on top of <TT>Foo</TT> and code to this new interface. Since you own <TT>FooAdaptor</TT>, you can absorb changes in <TT>Foo</TT> much more easily. While this is more work initially, carefully choosing the adaptor interface can make your code easier to write and more readable (a net win in the long run), as you can choose <TT>FooAdaptor</TT> to fit your specific domain much better than <TT>Foo</TT> does. </P></A><H1><A name="Using_Mocks_in_Tests">Using Mocks in Tests</A></H1><A name="Using_Mocks_in_Tests"><P>Once you have a mock class, using it is easy.

The reason is that this allows a user to set up the default expectations in a mock object's constructor or the test fixture's set-up phase and then customize the mock by writing more specific expectations in the test body. So, if you have two expectations on the same method, you want to put the one with more specific matchers <STRONG>after</STRONG> the other, or the more specific rule would be shadowed by the more general one that comes after it. </P></A><H2><A name="Ordered_vs_Unordered_Calls">Ordered vs Unordered Calls</A></H2><A name="Ordered_vs_Unordered_Calls"><P>By default, an expectation can match a call even though an earlier expectation hasn't been satisfied.
