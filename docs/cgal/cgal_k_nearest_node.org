* k nearest neighbor searching

Spatial searching typically consists of a preprocessing phase and a searching phase.
In the preprocessing phase one builds a search structure and in the searching phase
one makes the queries. In the preprocesing phase the user builds a tree data structure
storing the spatial data. In the searching phase the user invokes a searching method
to browse the spatial data.

** Neighbor searching is implemented by the following four classes:
*** CGAL::Orthogonal_k_neighbor_search
*** CGAL::K_neighbor_search<Traits, GeneralDistance, Splitter, SpatialTree>

** Splitting Rules
